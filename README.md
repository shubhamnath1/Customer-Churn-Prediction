# Projects Overview
Data visualization helps  in presenting billions of data points into meaningful insights. It is a very important tool for all the data scientists to learn and understand the data in more details. Visualization also helps business leaders to take important decisions for company growth and to move in the right direction. 

We often order food from food delivery apps like Zomato, Swiggy. Sometimes it often takes time to deliver the food. There are factors which impact the delivery time of the food.

In this hackathon we are going to work on a data visualization challenge to analyse and visualize the food delivery time from the same location but different cuisines and rating of the restaurants.

Note: For best experience upload all the visualization in A4 Landscape format only.
