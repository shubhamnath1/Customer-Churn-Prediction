Customer churn prediction

Problem Description :
Customer churn is the term used to describe the loss of customers from a business or service. It 
is an important metric for businesses to monitor as it can have a significant impact on revenue 
and profitability. In this project, we will be predicting customer churn for a telecommunications 
company based on various customer attributes and their usage patterns.


Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers of a 
telecommunications company. It includes demographic information such as age, gender, and 
income, as well as information about the customer’s account such as contract type, payment 
method, and monthly charges. Additionally, it includes information about the customer’s usage 
of the company’s services such as the number of phone lines, internet usage, and type of 
service. The dataset also includes a binary variable indicating whether the customer has 
churned or not.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on 
their demographic and usage patterns. By identifying customers who are at high risk of 
churning, the company can take proactive measures to retain them and reduce churn rates.

Framework and Steps:
1. Data Collection: Collect the dataset from the data source.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing 
duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the relationship between 
the target variable and the features, and identify any patterns or trends in the data.

4. Feature Selection: Select the relevant features for the prediction model using feature 
selection techniques.

5. Model Selection: Select the appropriate machine learning model based on the problem 
type and data characteristics.

6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation 
metrics.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve 
its performance.

9. Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.


Code Explanation : 
Here is the simple explanation for the code which is provided in the code.py file.
The code is for customer churn prediction using a dataset. The dataset contains information 
about customers and their churn status. We first load the dataset and perform data 
exploration, checking for missing values, data types, and correlations between features.
Next, we preprocess the data by encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and 
splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Then, we train several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, 
Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. We evaluate the models using accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Finally, we select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics and make predictions 
on new data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

Future Work : 
1. Feature Engineering: One potential area for future work is feature engineering. This 
process involves analyzing the existing features and creating new ones that may be 
more predictive of customer churn. For example, new features could be created based 
on customer behavior, such as the number of customer service calls made or the 
amount of time spent on the website.
2. Advanced Modeling Techniques: Another area for future work is exploring more 
advanced modeling techniques. This could include trying out different algorithms such 
as gradient boosting, neural networks, or ensemble models to improve the predictive 
power of the model.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: In order to achieve the best possible performance, the model’s 
hyperparameters must be tuned. This involves adjusting the settings of the model to 
improve its ability to predict customer churn. Hyperparameter tuning can be performed 
using tools such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
4. Deploying the Model: After developing and tuning the model, the next step is to deploy 
it in a production environment. This involves creating an API that can be integrated with 
other applications and setting up infrastructure to handle predictions in real-time.
5. Monitoring and Updating the Model: Once the model is deployed, it is important to 
monitor its performance and update it as necessary. This can involve tracking the 
model’s accuracy over time, identifying changes in customer behavior that may impact 
the model’s predictions, and retraining the model periodically to ensure that it remains 
accurate.
